Storm's Tweaks Mod is a very small mod that adds some configuration options that change some small mechanics of the game.
This mod allows you to:

-Configure the kill count for each pillar
-Disable all damage variance for players and enemies
-Disable dev items dropping from treasure bags
-Allow Axes and Hammers to benefit from Mining Speed buffs.
-Allows Mechancials tools to benefit from mining speed buffs (Drills, Chainsaws, and Jackhammers)
