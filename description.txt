Storm's Tweaks Mod is a very small mod that adds some configuration options that change some small mechanics of the game.
This mod allows you to:

-Configure the kill count for each pillar
-Allows for "super crits", if your crit chance is above 100% however much by is the chance to performa  super crit, which deals x3 damage as a regualr hit
-Disable all damage variance for players and enemies
-Allow Axes and Hammers to benefit from Mining Speed buffs.
-Allows Mechancial tools to benefit from mining speed buffs (Drills, Chainsaws, and Jackhammers)
-Allow all accessories to be placed in vanity slots
-Prevent prehardmode enemy stats from scaling in Expert hardmode 
-Disable dev items dropping from treasure bags
-Prevent your own explosives from dealing self-damage (Doesn't work with exploding bullets for some reason)
-Make falling stars fall as items instead of projectiles
-Make Blazing Wheels and Spike balls killable
